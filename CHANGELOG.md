# Changelog

* 7 December 2017
  * Moved my 3.0 filters from a single gist to a Github repository, so it's easier to browse the filters.
  * Cleared the individual filters' changelogs and gave them all a short pointer to this repository.
  * Backported tiered gem highlighting from Maps to Leveling filter, but actually show all gems while Leveling.
  * Backported top-end wand highlighting from Strict to Maps and Leveling filters.
  * Removed individual changelogs, and added a last changed date to each instead.
